ASSUMPTIONS

- Removed releases without commits
- Removed tickets without commits (they had already been used for calculating proportion)
- Assumed that the dates on the tickets are accurate (since they are used to calculate OV and FV)
- Assumed that the tickets labelled as defect are really defect
- Increment can underestimate the performance of classifiers
